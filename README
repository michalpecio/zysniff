zysniff 0.92.2

Receives UDP packet trace from a ZyNOS-based router and feeds it to a TAP
interface for processing with your favourite sniffer.

Zysniff should be easily portable to all *nixes with user space tunneling
support, but this version works only on Linux 2.6 because of differences in
TUN/TAP creation API.


USAGE:
zysniff <port> [<buf>]
    * port - UDP port to listen on
    * buf  - How much memory to allocate for incoming datagrams. Deafults to
             280 because my router doesn't capture more than the first 256
             bytes of every packet even if I tell it to create bigger trcp
             buffer. 24 extra bytes are for header added by ZyNOS.

On the router:

tc> sys trcpacket destroy
tc> sys trcpacket create 1 256	// create new buffer with one big entry
tc> sys trcpacket channel mpoa00 incoming
tc> sys trcpacket channel enet0 bothway
tc> sys trcpacket channel enet1 none
tc> sys trcpacket channel enet2 outgoing
tc> sys trcpacket udp addr 10.1.2.3	// destination IP address
tc> sys trcpacket udp port 1234	// and UDP port
tc> sys trcpacket udp switch on
tc> sys trcpacket switch on
